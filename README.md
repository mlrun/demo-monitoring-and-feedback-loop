# Banking LLM monitoring and feedback loop demo

This demo showcases how to train, deploy, and monitor LLM using an approach described as [LLM as a judge](https://www.mlrun.org/blog/llm-as-a-judge-practical-example-with-open-source-mlrun/).

This demo illustrates training an open-source model to answer banking-related questions only. It does this by analyzing the responses that were generated by the model traffic, and retraining the model according to the performance. The model performance analysis is done by a separate LLM that judges the results. Once the dataset is large enough, you can then retrain the model and mesure the performance again.
